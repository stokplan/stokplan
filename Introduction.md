<h3>Introducing <a href='stokplan.com'>stokplan.com</a>: The Ultimate Free Investing Website</h3>

Welcome to <a href='stokplan.com'>stokplan.com</a>, a website dedicated to serving my personal investing needs. Today, I invite all of you to join me and take advantage of the features and benefits this platform offers. Your valuable experiences and feedback will help us refine the system and create value for everyone involved. Here's what you can expect when you access our website:

1. <b>Explore a World of Events</b>: Discover daily opportunities across a comprehensive list of approximately 700 tickers, including most of the SP500 and expandable options. Our events encompass various indicators such as overbought/sold, gap up/down, MACD cross up/down, EMA cross up/down, and consolidation on day or week charts. By reviewing these events before the market opens, you can effectively plan your investment or trading strategies. Tailor the events to match your unique style, as specific events may work better for you. Furthermore, you can even time travel to the past by selecting a specific date to analyze historical events. For example, take a look at the EMA crossing above the SMA for TSLA on May 22, 2023, as shown in the figure below. Verify the results using your own chart.

<ol start="2"><li><b>Stay Alert with Alarms</b>: Once you have identified specific tickers of interest, setting up alarms becomes crucial. You can configure alarms based on price, RSI, MACD, EMA, and SMA for various chart intervals like 5 minutes, 1 day, and 1 week. Let's say it's June 12, 2023, and GOOGL is priced at $122.51. If you want to be notified when it reaches $107, simply create an alarm with the condition "price <= 107". These alarms will check the price at regular intervals during market hours, ensuring you never miss an opportunity or deviate from your plan. Additionally, RSI alarms can assist with your entry points during the day. For instance, if you plan to acquire AAPL but wish to wait for an optimal price, set an RSI alarm to notify you when the RSI falls below 40. All notifications are conveniently sent via email, so be sure to register your account using a valid email address.</li></ol>
  
<ol start="3"><li><b>Effortlessly Manage Watch Lists</b>: Our platform offers an efficient way to organize multiple watch lists, empowering you to effectively track the technical indicators of your selected tickers. By doing so, you can identify the current trends, whether they are bullish or bearish, and compare their price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios. This allows you to closely monitor the stocks that matter to you and make well-informed investment decisions.<br><br>In the example watch list shown below, each ticker is accompanied by its P/E ratio and a combination of technical indicators that indicate the trend of the ticker. The movement of these indicators is crucial in ensuring that we are on the right track and not heading towards unfavorable outcomes.<br><br>The technical indicators include the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) for both daily and weekly charts, as well as the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crossing the Simple Moving Average (SMA) for both daily and weekly charts.<br><br>Let's take NVDA as an example. It shows all green indicators, indicating a very bullish trend. On the other hand, GOOGL and META have the MACD for the daily chart turning red, suggesting a potential slowdown in the short term. Interpreting these indicators effectively relies on your experience and knowledge.</li></ol>
