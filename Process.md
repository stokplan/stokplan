<h1>Process Flow: Events - Watch Lists - Alarms</h1>

The process of investing or trading begins with daily events. To access the Events page, simply navigate to the Events section in the menu.

On the Events page, you can select the specific event you're interested in. You have the option to view the event on either a daily or weekly chart, and you can also select the date of the event.

Events are carefully calculated on a daily basis for both the day and week charts. These events provide signals based on various technical indicators such as RSI (overbought/sold), MACD (up/down), EMA (cross up/down SMA), gap up/down, and consolidation patterns. These signals help you plan your trading strategies. For example, some traders may favor gap up events accompanied by high volume, as it often indicates a reversal. Once you identify a signal from the daily events, you can add the corresponding ticker to your watch list.

In the watch list, you can view the ticker's P/E ratio and technical indicators. You can group tickers from the same industry into the same watch list for convenient monitoring. To access detailed indexes or ratios of a particular ticker, simply select the ticker from the watch list.

Once you've selected a specific ticker, you may want to set up an alarm to notify you when the trend changes from bearish to bullish. For instance, if a ticker's price is consistently declining, you might want to set a target price to enter the market. In this case, you can set up a price-based alarm. If you want to ensure a complete trend reversal, you can choose signals such as MACD or SMA on both the short-term (daily) and long-term (weekly) charts.

After completing all the necessary setups, it's time to relax and wait for the right opportunity. Avoid making impulsive decisions due to FOMO (fear of missing out). Follow this process to help streamline your investment journey.

I hope this process provides valuable insights and assists you in making informed trading decisions.
